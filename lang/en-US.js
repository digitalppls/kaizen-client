It was created by Crypto Finance AG and launched on December 31, 2016 with a value of 1,000. As of June 2020 it is managed and calculated by BITA GmbH and has a value around 2,650. Because cryptocurrencies often move up or down in tandem it isn‚Äôt unusual for this index to make very strong moves in either direction.",

Composition buffers are used in order to achieve this fixed number of components and this ensures the stability of the index. The end result is that the Crypto index accurately represents the performance of only the largest and most traded tokens in the world.",

  "COIN10_METHODOLOGY_ITEM_4": "BITA evaluates changes in rankings at each reconstitution period, taking into account a 30% selection buffer. This means that any token that falls below the 13th position is removed and replaced by an incoming token. Any token that successfully grows into the first 30% of the ranking, are exempt from the selection buffer and they enter the index automatically.",

    "TEXT_1": "The company operator of the project \"Industrial Mining\" places the mining equipment on an oil field, with the company owner of the field has an agreement on the use of associated gas. Electricity is generated by the power plant gPG (gas piston generator) which uses associated gas of the deposit as fuel. The pilot 2 MW GPG generator is already in operation at the field and shows stable trouble-free operation. There is also a possibility of developing the capacity potential up to 8 MW. From the experience of operating a GPG power plant, the cost of 1 kWh has been identified and is $0.007, which is significantly lower than the cost of electricity from suppliers in the market. 70% of the mined bitcoins are sent to the liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges, 30% is sent for operating costs including electricity, company management and the purchase of new mining equipment.",
