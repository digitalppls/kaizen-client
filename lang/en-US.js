Because it is composed of the top ten cryptocurrencies it is widely accepted as a benchmark for the strength or weakness of the broader cryptocurrency market. It was created by Crypto Finance AG and launched on December 31, 2016 with a value of 1,000. As of June 2020 it is managed and calculated by BITA GmbH and has a value around 2,650. Because cryptocurrencies often move up or down in tandem it isn‚Äôt unusual for this index to make very strong moves in either direction.",

  "COIN10_METHODOLOGY_ITEM_1": "Only tokens or coins that are traded exclusively at exchanges, which have passed quantitative and qualitative requirements are taken into consideration and ranked by market capitalisation.",

Composition buffers are used in order to achieve this fixed number of components and this ensures the stability of the index. The end result is that the Crypto index accurately represents the performance of only the largest and most traded tokens in the world.",

  "COIN10_METHODOLOGY_ITEM_4": "BITA evaluates changes in rankings at each reconstitution period, taking into account a 30% selection buffer. This means that any token that falls below the 13th position is removed and replaced by an incoming token.
